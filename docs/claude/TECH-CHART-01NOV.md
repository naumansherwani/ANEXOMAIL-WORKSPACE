## TECHNOLOGY CHART UPDATE — 1 Nov 2026 10:00 PKT (founder order 09:51, verified by fetch, nothing copied from unverified text)

| Technology | Verified fact (source seen 1 Nov 2026) | Awam side | Founder side | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WebTransport (browser) | Baseline: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari 26.4 (Mar 2026) | LIVE: Rust `wtrpc`, UDP 3443, `wtransport` 0.1.14 + quinn 0.10.2 (old) | PLANNED, step 7a, `wtransport` 0.7.1 (latest on docs.rs) | awam upgrade 0.1.14 -> 0.7.x only on founder order after cutover |
| Caddy and WebTransport | quic-go gives HTTP/3 (default since Caddy 2.6). Caddy does not proxy WebTransport itself; maintainer points to `caddy-l4` for HTTP/3 passthrough. Issue 5086 page did not mention WebTransport, so the status stays unconfirmed | UDP 3443 is bound directly by Rust, not through Caddy | same: Rust binds UDP itself; Caddy L4 only if needed, tested first | 7a |
| MoQ (Media over QUIC) | `draft-ietf-moq-transport-22` dated 1 Oct 2026, still a WG draft, NO RFC; IESG milestone Dec 2026. Wire format still changes between drafts. Cloudflare relay: tech preview since Aug 2025 (draft-07 subset); self-serve relay beta Jul 2026 (secondary source). Cloudflare and moq.dev relays were not interoperable as of Jun 2026 | PLANNED for ANEXOChat one-to-many (channels, live rooms, announcements) behind a flag, pinned to one draft | same module, shared | after ANEXOChat core; never before |
| MoQ claims NOT verified | "Meta relay", "production ready", "kills WebRTC" from the pasted text. Do not write these anywhere as fact | - | - | - |
| Two-way calls | MoQ is NOT the right fit for 2-way calling; WebRTC stays (TURN doc: anexovideochat-turn.md) | WebRTC | WebRTC | unchanged |
| DBSC | Chrome 146 on Windows since 9 Apr 2026, macOS later | PLANNED | step 7b | 7b |
| Hybrid post-quantum TLS (X25519MLKEM768) | Chrome default; needs Go 1.24+ in Caddy. NOT yet checked on our server, so NOT claimed | check pending | check pending | 7b |
| TLS symmetric cipher | Server negotiated TLSv1.3 + TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (founder's openssl output). So "256-bit TLS" on the splash is inaccurate; use "TLS 1.3" | fix splash wording on awam only with founder word | founder splash says TLS 1.3 | 7b |
| Merkle audit ledger (E107) | RFC 6962-style; kernel 0.6.0 `merkle@1` | n/a | GREEN | step 5 done |

Honest answer to "tumhay ati hai kya": yes, Rust + tokio + wtransport + quinn are written here already (awam `wtrpc`). The website's WebTransport was NOT rewritten; it is old (0.1.14) and works.

FOUNDER DECISION 1 Nov 10:04: MoQ is built by us (own Rust relay on wtransport), no Cloudflare relay/API. Service = systemd, never pm2/Bun. Not started; comes after ANEXOChat core.
